# Several Saras in one app (Phase 68)

Every Sara app keeps a **list of Sara servers**, each with **its own sign-in**, and switches
between them from a menu without signing out. Useful when you have a Sara at home and one at
work, or several Saras on one computer or server (1.6.1: each on its own port or address, for
example `http://192.168.1.20:7860` and `http://192.168.1.20:7862`).

One server is **in use** at a time in each window. Removing a server signs that app out of that
server only; the others stay signed in.

## What every app keeps (the "server profile")

| | |
|---|---|
| **id** | A short id (`s1`, `s2`, …) that never changes, even when you rename it |
| **name** | Her name on that server (filled in after the first sign-in), until you rename it. Two servers with the same name get the address added: *Sara (192.168.1.20:7862)* |
| **address** | Scheme, host and port: `https://sara.example.com`, `http://127.0.0.1:7882`. A different address is a different server: changing an address means adding it again and signing in there |
| **sign-in** | Kept where the platform keeps secrets (below), never in the list itself and never shown to a page |
| **last used**, **emoji** | For sorting and telling them apart |

Where each sign-in lives:

| App | The list | Each server's sign-in |
|---|---|---|
| Windows app | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Sara\desktop.ini` (`[servers]`, `[server.s1]`, …) | Its own WebView2 profile (the session cookie; WebView2 encrypts cookies with this Windows user's DPAPI key). `s1` is the profile used before 1.8 |
| Mac app | The app's preferences | Its own WebKit website data store (`s1`: the default store used before 1.8; others: `WKWebsiteDataStore(forIdentifier:)`, macOS 14 or newer) |
| iPhone app | The app's preferences | Its own WebKit website data store (as on the Mac) |
| Android app | The app's private settings | The server in use: the web view's cookie store. The others: their session cookies, encrypted with an AES key kept in the Android Keystore |
| VS Code | VS Code's secret storage (one entry, list and device tokens together) | Same |
| `sara-chat`, MCP bridge | `config.json` in sara-chat's config folder (readable by you only, 0600) | Same file (device tokens) |

A sign-in is only ever sent to the exact address it came from (scheme, host and port), so two
Saras on one host never see each other's sign-in, and a server can't read another server's data
through the app.

**Updating from one server:** nothing to do. The server the app used before becomes the first
in the list, still signed in.

## Adding, switching, removing

### Windows and Mac apps

- **Add:** tray icon (Windows) or menu bar icon (Mac) → *Your Saras* → **Add a Sara…**, or in the
  app: the **⇄** button at the top (shown once you have two) → **Add a server**, or Settings →
  Connections → This computer → **Your Saras…**. Type the address, then sign in with a code from
  that server's Settings → Devices and sign-in → **Add a phone or computer**.
- **Switch:** the tray/menu bar list (✓ = in use), or **⇄** → **Switch**. The "Can't reach your
  Sara" page also lists the other servers.
- **Remove:** **⇄** → **Remove** (Mac: also *Your Saras → Remove …*). The app signs out on that
  server and clears its sign-in here.
- **Rename:** **⇄** → **Rename**.
- On a Mac with macOS 13, the app keeps one server (several need macOS 14).

### Phone apps (Android, iPhone)

- **Add:** scan the QR code from *Add a phone or computer* on the other server and choose **Open
  in the Sara app**: the app asks **Add this Sara?** (Cancel is the default; only add links you
  made yourself). Or **⇄** → **Add a server** / Settings → Connections → Phone and notifications
  → **Your Saras…**, then type the address and the code.
- **Switch, rename, remove:** the **⇄** button at the top of the chat (shown once you have two).
- **Notifications come from every server:** Android checks each saved server (about every 15
  minutes, each with its own sign-in; *Instant notifications* follow the server in use). The
  iPhone registers for Apple notifications with each server while you use it; each push says
  which server it came from. **Tapping a notification opens the right server**, and **Reply**
  from a notification goes to the server it came from.

### VS Code

- The status bar shows the server in use (`Sara`'s name); click it, or run **Sara: Switch server**.
- **Sara: Add a server** signs in to another one with a device code; **Sara: Sign out of this
  server** removes only the one in use. Each workspace keeps its own conversation on each server.

### `sara-chat`

```sh
sara-chat servers add https://work.example.com --name Work   # sign in with a code
sara-chat servers                 # list (* = in use)
sara-chat servers use Work        # switch (by name, id, address or host:port)
sara-chat ask "hi" --server home  # one command against another server
sara-chat servers rename Work Office
sara-chat servers remove Office   # signs out there, forgets only that one
```

`sara-chat login <address>` still works (it adds the server or signs it in again).

### MCP bridge

`node sara-mcp.ts --server Work` (or `SARA_SERVER=Work`) uses the server saved by `sara-chat`
under that name, with its own sign-in. With an address (`--server https://…`) it works as before
with `SARA_API_KEY`; an API key is never sent to a server picked by name.

## What on your computer follows the selected server

There is no background "remote control" connection from a server into your computer. What a Sara
can use on your computer is what an app sends it while you use it, and that always goes to the
**server in use** only:

| App | What she can use here | Indicator |
|---|---|---|
| Windows / Mac app | Notifications, the microphone in calls, files you pick or download | **⇄** dialog: *"<name> (the server in use) can use this computer …"*; the tray/menu bar tooltip names the server |
| Phone apps | Microphone, camera, location for place reminders, photos you share | **⇄** dialog |
| VS Code | The files and selections you send her | The status bar item and its tooltip: *"Sara on <name> (<host>) can use this computer …"*; "Sent with it" names the server |
| `sara-chat` | `ask --dir` folder overviews, `send` files | With several servers, *"Sending … to <name> on <host>"* |

Never two servers at once: switching moves all of it to the server you pick. (Decision: one at a
time, no switch to allow more; the desktop notification path is the page's, so desktop apps notify
for the server in use only.)

## For developers

- The page asks the app through `window.SaraDesktop.call('servers' | 'useServer' | 'addServer' |
  'removeServer' | 'renameServer' | 'serverName')` (desktop) or `window.SaraPhone.servers()` and
  friends (phones). It only ever gets ids, names and hosts.
- iPhone pushes: `POST /api/push/apns/register` takes an optional `profile` (the app's id for
  that server, `[\w-]{1,40}`); the server sends it back as `profile` in every push to that device.
- Tests: `test/phase68.test.ts` (the sara-chat profile store and its migration, MCP server
  selection, the VS Code profile logic, the push tag).
