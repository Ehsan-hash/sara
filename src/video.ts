// Phase 69: video calls. A video call is a normal call (live or classic) with her moving portrait
// shown large in the app; that part needs nothing from the server. What the server does here is the
// owner's optional camera: still pictures (JPEG, downscaled in the app) that she may look at.
//
// Rules, all enforced here and not only in the app:
// - Off unless the owner turns the camera on; a picture is sent only while it's on.
// - Nothing is written to disk: the newest picture is kept in memory for a short while (classic
//   calls take it with the next thing you say), then dropped; live calls pass it straight on.
// - Pictures go only to the model that answers on this call, and only if it can look at pictures;
//   otherwise the camera is a self-view and the app says so.
// - Refused in the demo, in group and partner chats, when "Nothing leaves this computer" is on and
//   the model isn't on this computer, in private conversations with a cloud model, and for an hour
//   after a safety block (the minors check) in that conversation.
// - At most one picture every few seconds (the owner's setting, never under MIN_GAP_MS) and a
//   per-call cap.
